<!-- A deeper dive into flexbox
Yesterday was a big day, so there is no shame in taking a break at this point!

If you're loving flexbox (or perhaps still a little confused by it!), I do have a 3-part series on YouTube that goes much deeper than we've looked so far, and could help you grasp it.

You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjMSb9c06AjRlTpvxL3otpUd

You won't need this to complete any of the challenges in the course and a lot of it will be covered in the coming days, but if you really want some more material today, really understanding flexbox is a good place to start.  -->
